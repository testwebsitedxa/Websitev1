# Analytics Website

Live Version: https://rhyse96.github.io/Analytics-Website-Landing-Page/

<p>Another nice design I found online. Again using the BEM naming convention which seems a bit overkill for a landing page but i can see the use in it for larger projects. I used grid and flex a lot in this project, and created some snazzy looking lines using transform and a border-top. There is also a cool horizontal scroller for the pricing section at the bottom, which turns into a scroller on mobile. Here's a link to the design: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1300726462461630527/ecoswap-landing-page</p>

Here is a screencapture of the entire coded site(also see the mobile screenshot below):
